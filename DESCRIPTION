Description: Phenotype Aware Components Analysis (PACA) is a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonical 
  correlation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic variation. PACA can be used to define 
  de novo subtypes that are more likely to reflect molecular heterogeneity, especially in challenging cases 
  where the phenotypic heterogeneity may be masked by a myriad of strong unrelated effects in the data.
