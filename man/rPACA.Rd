rpaca(
  X,
  Y,
  k = NULL,
  niter = 10,
  batch = 100,
  rank = 5,
  thrsh = 10,
  scale = FALSE,

\arguments{
\item{X}{\eqn{m} by \eqn{n_1} matrix; \cr
Case (foreground) input data matrix. \cr
It is recommended to normalize the feature scales as appropriate for the data modality.
E.g. quantile normalization (or other comparable approaches) for RNAseq data.}

\item{Y}{\eqn{m} by \eqn{n_0} matrix; \cr
Control (foreground) input data matrix. \cr
It is recommended to normalize the feature scales as appropriate for the data modality.
E.g. quantile normalization (or other comparable approaches) for RNAseq data.}

\item{k}{positive integer, optional (default: \eqn{NULL}); \cr
Number of, \eqn{k}, dimensions of shared variation to be removed from case data \code{X}. \cr
When \eqn{k = NULL} (default), K is automatically infered, i.e, we run auto rPACA by default.}

\item{niter}{Positive integer; \cr
Number random sampling iterations.}

\item{batch}{Positive integer; \cr
Number of cases/controls to be sampled for the training set at each iteration. \cr
Note that \eqn{k < batch-1} and \eqn{batch < min{m, n1, n0}}.}

\item{rank}{Positive integer, optional (default \eqn{5}); \cr
Number of dominant principle components to be computed for the corrected case data.}

\item{thrsh}{Positive real value, optional (default \eqn{10.0}); \cr
Threshold value for the maximum ratio of variance in \emph{PACA} corrected \code{X} PCs and the variance it explain in Y
which indicates the presence of residual shared variation in X.\cr
Only used when \code{k = NULL}.}

\item{info}{Integer, optional (default: 1); \cr
Verbosity level for the log generated. \cr
0: Errors and warnings only \cr
1: Basic informational messages \cr
2: More detailed informational messages \cr
3: Debug mode, all informational log is dumped}
}
\value{
\code{rpaca} returns a list containing the following components:
\describe{
   \item{x}{        \eqn{n_1} by \eqn{rank} matrix; \cr
                    the projections / scores of the randomized \emph{PACA} corrected case data.
   }
   \item{eigs}{   vector of size \eqn{rank}; \cr
                    the eigen values of the returned PACA PC components.
   }
  \item{k.iter}{  vector of size \eqn{niter}; \cr
                     the number of shared dimensions removed at each iteration.}
   }
}
\description{
This is the randomized version of the basic \code{\link{PACA}} algorithm.
rPACA allows us to apply PACA in regimes where p << n, i.e., in cases where the number of
samples is greater than the number of features.
