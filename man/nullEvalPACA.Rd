\title{PACA Null Case Evaluation (nullEvalPACA)}
\usage{
nullEvalPACA(X, Y, k, nPerm = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{\eqn{n_1} by \eqn{m} matrix; \cr
Case (foreground) input data matrix. \cr
It is recommended to normailize the feature scales as appropriate for the data modality.
E.g. quantile normalization (or other comparable approaches) for RNAseq data.}

\item{Y}{\eqn{n_0} by \eqn{m} matrix; \cr
Control (foreground) input data matrix. \cr
It is recommended to normailize the feature scales as appropriate for the data modality.
E.g. quantile normalization (or other comparable approaches) for RNAseq data.}

\item{k}{Positive integer, \eqn{k > 1}; \cr
Number of, \eqn{k}, dimensions of shared variation to be removed from case data \code{X}.}

\item{nPerm}{Positive integer, optional (default \eqn{100}); \cr
Number of random permutations to build the emperical null distribution.}
}
\value{
\code{nullEvalPACA} returns a list containing the following components:
\describe{
   \item{pval}{     non-negative real value; \cr
                    the significance of rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no subphenotypic structure in the case data \code{X}.
   }
   \item{empVar}{   non-negative real value; \cr
                    the variance of the top \emph{PACA} PC of the case data (\code{xtil}).
   }

   \item{nullVars}{ list of size \eqn{nPerm}; \cr
                    the variances of the top \emph{PACA} PC of each of the permuted null data.
   }
}
}
\description{
This method applies a simple case/control label permutation approach to qunatify the
statistical significance of the presence of subphenotypic variation unique to the cases, for a given fixed \eqn{k}.
The procedure should be able to reject the null (no subphenotypic variation) when there is sufficently
strong variation unique to the cases.
