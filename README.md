Phenotype Aware Components Analysis (**PACA**)
is a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonical correlation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic variation. PACA can be used to define *de novo* subtypes that are more likely to reflect molecular heterogeneity, especially in challenging cases where the phenotypic heterogeneity may be masked by a myriad of strong unrelated effects in the data.

## Installation

**PACA** is implemented as a **R** (>= v4) packages which depends on the following :

* Rcpp (>= v1.0)
* RcppEigen (>= v3.4)
* stats (>= v4.1)

You can install **PACA** using *devtools*:

``` r
devtools::install_github("adigorla/PACA")
```

Please see troubleshooting at the bottom for compilation issues.

## Usage

### PACA

The `paca` commmand runs the basic **PACA** algorithm after automatically estimating the number of shared dimensions `k` to be removed and returns components capturing variation unique to the cases. It chooses `k` which maximizes the variation unique to cases in a given case/control dataset. 
``` r
# load package
library(PACA)

# load data
X <- read.table("case_data1.txt")
Y <- read.table("control_data1.txt")
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
>All PACA functions functions the input matrices to be of shape **features-by-samples (MxN)**. So if input data is NxM, transpose both matrices to MxN
> ```r
> Xt <- t(X)
> Yt <- t(Y)
> ```
The input data, `X` & `Y` needs to be of the form features-by-samples (MxN), where M > N. We assume the features are scaled as appropriate for the data type (e.g., quantile normalization for RNAseq data). Then the input data needs to be scaled along the sample axis, like below.
``` r
# standardize 
Xt.std <- scale(Xt, center = T, scale = T)
Yt.std <- scale(Yt, center = T, scale = T)

# run PACA (and infer k)
set.seed(4499)
PACA.res <- paca(Xt.std, Yt.std)

# return the top 5 (defult rank) unique components of the case data
print(dim(PACA.res$x)) # Nx5

# return the corrected case data
print(dim(PACA.res$xtil)) # MxN

```
<!-- NOTE: for all examples we assume the the number of samples, N, is the same for cases and controls for simplicity. In reality, the number of cases and controls can be different. `paca` only requires the number of features, M, to be the same and alinged in the case/control data. -->


Users also have the option to run the `paca` algorithm with a fixed `k`. This would return the unique components in the cases at the user-defined `k`. Again, the input data, `X` & `Y` needs to be of form samples-by-features (NxM), where M > N.  
``` r
# standardize 
Xt.std <- scale(Xt, center = T, scale = T)
Yt.std <- scale(Yt, center = T, scale = T)

# run PACA with fixed k
PACA.res.k10 <- paca(Xt.std, Yt.std, k = 10)

# return the top 5 (defult rank) unique components of the cases, after correcting for the top 10 shared components
print(dim(PACA.res$x)) # Nx5

# the dimension of the corrected case data
print(dim(PACA.res$xtil)) # MxN
```

Please refer to the [PACA man page](man/PACA.Rd) for more detailed usage information.

### Randomized (r)PACA

`rpaca` is a randomized extension of the basic `paca` algorithm. `rpaca` allows us to apply **PACA** in regimes where M << N, i.e., in cases where the number of samples is greater than the number of features.

``` r
# load package
library(PACA)

# load data
Xt <- t(read.table("case_data1.txt"))
Yt <- t(read.table("control_data1.txt"))
```
The input data, `X` & `Y` needs to be of form samples-by-features (NxM).
While `rpaca` can automatically select `k`, we recommend users leverage domain knowledge when possible. For optimal results, consider performing a grid search with `rpaca` over a range of `k` values, selecting the one that maximizes an application-specific metric or aligns best with your field expertise.

``` r
# standardize 
Xt.std <- scale(Xt, center = T, scale = T)
Yt.std <- scale(Yt, center = T, scale = T)

# run for selected K
k.select <- 10

# run randomized PACA
set.seed(4499)
rPACA.res <- rpaca(Xt.std, Yt.std, k =  k.select, niter = 10, batch = 300, rank = 5)

# run randomized PACA
set.seed(4499)
autorPACA.res <- rpaca(Xt.std, Yt.std, niter = 10, batch = 300, rank = 5, thrsh = 10.0)


# the dimension of the returned unique components of the cases from rPACA with fixed K
print(dim(rPACA.res$x))

# the dimension of the returned unique components of the cases from auto rPACA
print(dim(autorPACA.res$x))

# print list of K selected in each iteration
print(autorPACA.res$k.iter)

```
`niter`, `rank` and `batch` are optional params. However, the users needs to make sure to set `batch` to `batch < min({M, N}` and `k < batch-1`. Increasing `niter` and/or `rank` empirically seems to increase the estimation accuracy of the randomized algorithm; however, at the expense of increased runtime. 
Please refer to the [rPACA man page](man/rPACA.Rd) for more detailed usage information.

### Null Testing

The `paca_null` algorithm allows users to test for the statistical significance of the presence of phenotypic variation unique to the cases, for a given fixed `k`. This pocedure should be able to reject the null (no subphenotypic variation) when there is sufficiently strong variation unique to the cases.

``` r
# load package
library(PACA)

# load data
Xt <- t(read.table("case_data1.txt"))     # NxM -> MxN
Yt <- t(read.table("control_data1.txt"))  # NxM -> MxN

# test for selected K
k.h0 <- 10
set.seed(4499)
PACA.nulltest <- paca_null(Xt.std, Yt.std, k.h0, nperm = 100)

# p-value of rejecting H0 there is no case specific variation PACA PC1
print(PACA.nulltest$pval)
```
The input data, `X` & `Y` needs to be of form features-by-samples (MxN), where M > N. Assuming the features are scaled as appropriate for the data type. Increasing `nperm` increases the precision of the `pval` estimate.
Please refer to the [PACA man page](man/PACA_null.Rd) for more detailed usage information.

## Troubleshooting

<summary>Instructions</summary>

If you are using a mac and having installation issues, try installing homebrew or xcode then reinstalling **Rcpp** and **RcppEigen**. 

#### R >= 4.0+ on M1/2 Macs
If you are having issues compiling R/Rcpp code on the newer ARM (M1/2) Mac hardware, make you have `gcc(13+)` and `llvm` installed using homebrew.
``` bash 
brew install gcc && brew install llvm 
```

Then update the `Makevars` file in the `~/.R/` directory to the following:
```
# custom g++ makevars 
# adapeted from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65860439/installing-data-table-on-macos

GCC_LOC = /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/13.1.0                      # UPATDTE & CHECK  path is valid

CPPFLAGS=-I$(LLVM_LOC)/include -I$(BREW_LOC)/include -I$(RARM_LOC)/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
```
Make sure that the four "UPATDTE & CHECK path is valid" lines point to valid location on your machine. 

For all older versions of R and Intel Mac installation issues, please refer to the detailed instructions on the [The Coatless Professor](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/) website.
